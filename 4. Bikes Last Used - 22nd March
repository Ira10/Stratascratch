Find the last time each bike was in use. Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use (i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). 
Order the results by bikes that were most recently used.

------------- SQL -------------- forgot to use group by ------ as in, there are times that bikes are used multiple times

select bike_number,MAX(end_time) as last_used
FROM dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
GROUP BY bike_number
ORDER BY last_used desc;


---------- Python --------------

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
dc_bikeshare_q1_2012.groupby('bike_number')['end_time'].max()
dc_bikeshare_q1_2012[['bike_number','end_time']].rename(columns={"end_time": "last_used"}).sort_values(by='last_used', ascending=False)

-----stratascratch solution ------
result = dc_bikeshare_q1_2012.groupby('bike_number')['end_time'].max().to_frame( 'last_used').reset_index().sort_values(by='last_used', ascending=False)
